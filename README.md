# Password Generator
This was a project where we were given some javascript for a password generrator and were supposed to figure out how to fix it.

# Requirements
Some of the parameters we needed to include were as followed.
Using prompts:
-Limiting the password to between 8 and 128 characters
-Asking the user if they wanted uppercase or lowercase letter
-Asking the user if they wanted specials characters
-Asking the user if the wanted numbers
-When using the button a passwording is generated in the number length you entered.

## How to Use
To start the generator, you press the "Generate Password" button and then a prompt asking you how long you want your password to be will pop up. Enter a number between 8 and 128, and you will be ask if you want to include lowercase letters, upper case letter, special characters, and numbers. By clicking "ok" on each respective prompt will add the respective parameters, hitting "Cancel" will leave the respective characters out.

## Technology Used
This project used HTML and Javascript.

## Code Examples
Some aspect of this project that I gained a better understanding of are "if else" statements and window prompts and alerts. Here is an example of some of my code.

## Problem's Faced
I was having an extrememly hard time getting the password to actually generate. I was not able to complete that function by the time the assignment was due.
